# golang-ast-inspection

Minimal eBPF-backed HTTP syscall profiler plus a tiny test service and traffic generator. Everything is wired for x86_64 Ubuntu (20/22/23) and Go 1.25.

## What’s here
- `cmd/server`: basic HTTP service on port 8080 with `/`, `/healthz`, `/echo`, `/slow`.
- `cmd/traffic`: small Go script that repeatedly hits the service.
- `cmd/profiler`: eBPF-powered profiler that attaches to socket syscalls and writes request/response metadata to a local file.
- `bpf/profiler.bpf.c`: BPF program (compiled via `bpf2go` during build).

## Setup (Ubuntu 20/22/23/25)
- Go toolchain 1.25+ 
- Install C libraries (I had to sudo on a lima VM):
```
apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    clang llvm make pkg-config libelf-dev zlib1g-dev linux-libc-dev libbpf-dev
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```
- set up necessary symlink:
```
arch="$(uname -m)" && \
case "${arch}" in \
    x86_64) multiarch="x86_64-linux-gnu" ;; \
    aarch64|arm64) multiarch="aarch64-linux-gnu" ;; \
    *) echo "Unsupported architecture: ${arch}" >&2; exit 1 ;; \
esac && \
ln -sf /usr/include/${multiarch}/asm /usr/include/asm
```

- The profiler filters on `HTTP_PORT` (default `8080`) and writes to `/output/ebpf_http.log` inside the container, mapped to `./output/ebpf_http.log` on the host.
- The traffic generator issues GET/POST traffic in a loop so you can see request/response bodies, methods, URLs, and status codes captured from syscall payloads.

## Local build
```bash
# Linux only; requires clang/llvm and kernel headers
go mod download
go generate ./pkg/profiler            # builds the BPF object via bpf2go (emits files under pkg/profiler with tag ebpf_build)
go build ./cmd/server                 # HTTP service
go build ./cmd/traffic                # traffic generator
go build -tags ebpf_build ./cmd/profiler  # profiler binary (uses generated bindings)
```

## Output format
Plain text lines with syscall-derived metadata and parsed HTTP hints:
```
ts=2024-04-08T18:24:10.123Z pid=1234 comm=curl dir=send src=127.0.0.1:57532 dst=127.0.0.1:8080 bytes=89 method=GET url=/echo body="" raw="GET /echo HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: ..."
```
Fields include URL, method, status (when parsing responses), request/response bodies (truncated), plus raw payload slices from the send/recv syscalls.
